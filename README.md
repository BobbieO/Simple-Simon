# Simple Simon

A basic simple simon game using JavaScript and jQuery for function, and Bootstrap CSS for styling.
This game features a randomizer for fadeOut-fadeIn functions to illustrate which element is selected. A listener event registers user selection, which is then checked against the game selection. If it matches, a jQuery statement is generated to affirm success and to count game repetitions. If the user errors, a fail statement is generated. The start button functions as both game start, and as a game restart which clears the field.

GAME INSTRUCTIONS:

1.) Click on the Start button to begin.

2.) A petal will flash.

3.) Click on the same petal. If successful, the game will select another random petal to add on to the end of the sequence.

4.) Your objective is to recall and mimic the pattern the game selects.

5.) The game will keep track of the number of rounds you are successful. This is displayed in the top right corner.

6.) If you miss any element of the pattern, the game will stop.

7.) Click the Start button to try again.
